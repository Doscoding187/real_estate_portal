## 2026-06-02 - Documentation Foundation

Date: 2026-06-02
Branch: recovery/lead-routing-verification-2026-06-02
Goal: Create the DLE docs foundation so future agents share the same product vision, recovery discipline, and implementation guardrails.
Files changed:
- docs/dle/DEVELOPMENT_LISTING_ENGINE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md
- docs/dle/RECOVERY_LOG.md
- docs/dle/MANUAL_FLOW_CHECKLIST.md
- docs/dle/PRODUCT_VISION.md
- docs/dle/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/dle/FIELD_OWNERSHIP_CONTRACT.md
- docs/dle/AGENT_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md
Focused tests run: Not applicable; documentation-only slice.
pnpm run check: Not run; documentation-only slice.
git diff --check: Passed.
Manual flows verified: None; this slice only creates documentation guardrails.
Remaining risks:
- Manual DLE browser flows still need a dedicated recovery audit.
- Autosave remains a future slice behind manual save/resume proof.
Next recommended slice: Run the DLE recovery audit and manual flow proof checklist.
Commit hash/tag: `97e9a7bb docs(dle): add source of truth and recovery discipline`
Uncommitted reason, if any: None. Slice committed.

## 2026-06-02 - Recovery Audit

Date: 2026-06-02
Branch: recovery/lead-routing-verification-2026-06-02
Goal: Run the source-of-truth recovery audit before continuing major DLE implementation work.
Files changed:
- docs/dle/RECOVERY_LOG.md
Focused tests run:
- Command: `bash -lc 'source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && pnpm vitest run server/lib/canonicalDevelopmentPayload.test.ts server/lib/developmentCanonicalSnapshot.test.ts server/lib/sanitizeDraftData.test.ts server/services/__tests__/developmentTransactionAggregates.test.ts server/__tests__/developerRouter.drafts.test.ts server/__tests__/developerRouter.edit-update.test.ts'`
- Result: Passed. 6 test files, 77 tests.
pnpm run check: Passed with `bash -lc 'source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && pnpm run check'`.
git diff --check: Passed after this log update. Direct trailing-whitespace scan of `docs/dle/` also passed.
Manual flows verified: None. Browser-level DLE flows still require a runtime/dev-server-capable environment.
Recovery audit evidence:
- Current branch: `recovery/lead-routing-verification-2026-06-02`
- Current status before this log update: only `docs/dle/` was untracked.
- Recent stable DLE tag present: `dle-wizard-recovery-verified-2026-06-02`
- Recent lead-routing recovery tag present: `lead-routing-recovery-verified-nodb-sessiondb-2026-06-02`
- Latest commit on branch: `d3c83631 fix(upload): support local media uploads for manual QA`
- Untracked files before this log update: `docs/dle/*`
- `git diff --stat` before this log update: empty because the docs folder was untracked.
- Node/pnpm note: this shell does not load Node by default; source `~/.nvm/nvm.sh` first. Verified Node `v22.22.3` and pnpm `10.4.1`.
Key DLE files confirmed present:
- server/lib/canonicalDevelopmentPayload.ts
- server/lib/developmentCanonicalSnapshot.ts
- server/lib/sanitizeDraftData.ts
- server/services/developmentService.ts
- shared/developmentDerived.ts
- shared/developmentReadiness.ts
- client/src/components/development-wizard/phases/UnitTypesPhase.tsx
- client/src/pages/DevelopmentDetail.tsx
- server/__tests__/developerRouter.edit-update.test.ts
- server/__tests__/developerRouter.drafts.test.ts
- server/lib/canonicalDevelopmentPayload.test.ts
- server/lib/developmentCanonicalSnapshot.test.ts
- server/services/__tests__/developmentTransactionAggregates.test.ts
Remaining risks:
- Manual browser flows remain unverified in this audit.
- `docs/dle/` remains uncommitted until user approval.
Next recommended slice:
- Then run browser-level manual flow proof for create, manual save draft, My Drafts, resume, publish, and public display.
