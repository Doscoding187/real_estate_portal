# Database Compatibility Exception Register

**Authority:** `docs/architecture/database-authority-policy.md`

## Current approved exceptions

None.

No database compatibility exception has been approved under this policy.

Existing code containing terms such as `legacy`, `compatibility`, `fallback`,
schema probing, alternate query strategies, or dual-model behavior does not
gain approval from historical presence.

Such code remains audit debt until Edward explicitly approves and registers it,
or an approved workstream removes it.

## Required exception record

Every approved exception must contain:

```text
Exception ID:
Status:

Approved by Edward on:
Business reason:
Canonical authority:
Exact files:
Tables and columns:
Permitted read direction:
Permitted write direction:
Failure and observability behavior:
Automated evidence:
Expiry or objective removal condition:
Removal workstream:
```

An incomplete or unregistered exception has no architectural authority.
