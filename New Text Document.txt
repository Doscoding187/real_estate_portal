Phase 1 backend is complete. Summary of what we've built:
Phase 1 backend complete
What we've built
1. Property CRUD API
properties.create — Create property listings with validation
properties.update — Update properties (ownership verified)
properties.delete — Delete properties (ownership verified)
properties.myProperties — Get user's properties
properties.deleteImage — Delete property images
2. S3 image upload system
upload.presign — Generate presigned URLs for direct S3 uploads
upload.direct — Direct upload via API (fallback)
upload.getUrl — Get public URLs for images
Supports AWS S3 (if configured) or storage proxy fallback
3. Database functions
getUserProperties() — Get user's properties
updateProperty() — Update with ownership check
deleteProperty() — Delete with ownership check
deletePropertyImage() — Delete images with ownership check
Progress
Backend:
Property CRUD API — complete
Image upload system — complete
Security (ownership checks) — complete
Frontend (next):
ImageUploader component
List Property page
Dashboard/My Properties page
What you can test now
You can test the backend endpoints via tRPC:
// Create propertytrpc.properties.create.useMutation()// Get my propertiestrpc.properties.myProperties.useQuery()// Upload imagetrpc.upload.presign.useMutation()
Next steps
Build the ImageUploader component — Multi-file upload with previews
Build the List Property page — Multi-step form for creating listings
Build the Dashboard page — View and manage your properties
Should I continue with the frontend components next? I can start with:
ImageUploader component
List Property page
Or the Dashboard page
Which should I build first?
