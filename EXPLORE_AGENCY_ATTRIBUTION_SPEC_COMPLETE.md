# Explore Agency Content Attribution - Spec Complete ✅

> **Historical implementation evidence — not operational authority.** This
> specification does not authorize its legacy migration runner, rollback SQL,
> seed, or deployment instructions. Current database work must follow the
> [Database Authority entry contract](docs/database-authority/00-database-authority-agent-entry.md),
> [Database Change Protocol](docs/database-authority/database-change-protocol.md),
> and [canonical migration README](server/migrations/README.md).

### 🗄️ Database Migration Files

1. **add-agency-attribution.sql** - Forward migration
   - Adds `agency_id` to `explore_shorts`
   - Adds `creator_type` and `agency_id` to `explore_content`
   - Creates 8 indexes for performance
   - Adds foreign key constraints
   - Includes validation constraints
   - Creates helpful views
   - Includes verification queries

2. **rollback-agency-attribution.sql** - Rollback script
   - Removes all changes safely
   - Drops views, constraints, indexes, columns
   - Includes verification queries

3. **run-agency-attribution-migration.ts** - Migration runner
   - Executes migration with progress tracking
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Verifies migration success
   - Shows statistics
   - Provides next steps

### 📊 Analysis Document

**EXPLORE_CONTENT_SOURCING_ANALYSIS.md** - Problem analysis
- Current state assessment
- Gap analysis
- Three implementation options
- Recommendations
- Action items
- Database schema additions

## Problem Solved

### Before
- ❌ Agencies cannot be credited for content
- ❌ No agency-level feeds
- ❌ No agency analytics
- ❌ Cannot showcase agency brand
- ❌ Inconsistent creator attribution

### After
- ✅ Agencies credited for content
- ✅ Dedicated agency feeds
- ✅ Comprehensive agency analytics
- ✅ Agency brand presence in Explore
- ✅ Consistent creator attribution model
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing content

## Key Features

### 1. Agency Feed Filtering
```typescript
const { data } = trpc.explore.getAgencyFeed.useQuery({
  agencyId: 1,
  limit: 20,
  includeAgentContent: true
});
```

### 2. Agency Analytics
```typescript
const { data } = trpc.explore.getAgencyAnalytics.useQuery({
  agencyId: 1,
  timeRange: '30d'
});
// Returns: totalContent, totalViews, engagementRate, 
//          agentBreakdown, topPerformingContent
```

### 3. Automatic Attribution
When agents upload content, their agency is automatically attributed (with opt-out).

### 4. Performance Optimized
- 8 new indexes for fast queries
- 5-minute cache for feeds
- 15-minute cache for analytics
- Query result caching

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database (Week 1)
- Use the canonical Database Change Protocol and migration README
- Update schema types
- Verify changes

### Phase 2: Backend (Week 1-2)
- Implement service methods
- Add API endpoints
- Add caching
- Write tests

### Phase 3: Frontend (Week 2-3)
- Create components
- Add hooks
- Integrate with UI
- Write tests

### Phase 4: Deploy (Week 3-4)
- Integration testing
- Performance testing
- Documentation
- Production deployment

## Quick Start

### 1. Database change authority
Use the canonical Database Change Protocol and migration README. The legacy
feature-specific migration runner described in this historical specification
is not an approved command.

### 2. Update Types
```bash
npm run db:generate
```

### 3. Implement Services
Follow tasks in `tasks.md` starting with Phase 2

### 4. Test
```bash
npm test -- agency-attribution
```

Legacy feature-specific migration and deployment artifacts are retired; any
future schema change must use the canonical migration authority.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Phase 7, Task 9)
- Service method functionality
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Cache behavior

### Property-Based Tests (Phase 7, Task 10)
1. Agency Attribution Consistency
2. Backward Compatibility
3. Foreign Key Integrity
4. Pagination Correctness
5. Migration Idempotency

### Integration Tests (Phase 7, Task 10)
- End-to-end feed flow
- Analytics calculation
- Cache invalidation
- Permission enforcement
- Migration and rollback

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Query performance < 500ms
- ✅ Zero data loss
- ✅ Cache hit rate > 80%

### Business
- Track agency feed usage
- Monitor content creation
- Measure engagement
- Track analytics usage

## Next Steps

1. **Review Spec** - Review with stakeholders
2. **Approve Design** - Get technical approval
3. **Database authority** - Follow the canonical Database Change Protocol
4. **Implement Backend** - Build services and APIs
5. **Build Frontend** - Create components
6. **Test** - Run all test suites
7. **Deploy** - Production deployment

## Support

For questions:
1. Review design document for technical details
2. Check requirements for acceptance criteria
3. See tasks for implementation steps
4. Consult analysis for problem context

## Status

✅ **Spec Complete - Ready for Implementation**

- [x] Requirements defined
