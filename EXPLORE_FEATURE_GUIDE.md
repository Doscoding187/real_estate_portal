## 📊 What Data You Need

To see content in Explore, you need:

1. **Properties in database** ✅ (You likely have these)
2. **Explore shorts/videos** ⚠️ (Need to upload via `/explore/upload`)
3. **Property images** ✅ (From your AWS S3)

### Quick Test Data
Use the approved guarded local/test lifecycle for local or demo data. This
guide does not authorize a feature-specific seed utility.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit the Explore page:**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No content showing"
- Check if you have properties in the database
- Use only the approved guarded local/test lifecycle for local or demo data;
  this historical guide does not authorize a seed script
- Check browser console for API errors

### "API returns 500 error"
- ✅ **FIXED!** We just added the missing database columns
- Restart your server to pick up changes

### "Videos not playing"
- Check if video URLs are valid
- Ensure AWS S3 URLs are accessible
- Check browser console for CORS errors
